Some Old Source Code

*Before Github, programmers would put links to code samples in their resum√©s. Here are some samples I used to provide. Back in the day. Before electricity. And yes, this is the actual text I used to introduce each snippet at the time.*

**Interview Answer**

Erich Finkelstein introduced me to the "balancing rocks" interview question. It's a math puzzle of the style you'll find at <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/">techinterview.org</a>. The nice thing about rock balancing is that it isn't an "aha" problem: there are several solutions of varying quality, so candidates have a great chance to show off their smarts by asking smart questions and considering various aproaches.

I'm not going to describe the math puzzle, but lately I've been asking candidates to check the correctness of their answers the nerdy way: by writing a program that checks it for them (ok, I usually don't have a lot of time, so I ask the candidate to write the algorithm out). In adherence with the Golden Rule, here're a few versions I whipped up in a few minutes (each) that do the job.

**Java Temporal Entity Relationship Modelling Framework**

These classes are part of a personal research project. I don't want to say too much about the project: the point is to create a working application, not a research thesis. I arbitrarily grabbed a few source code files that I happened to be editing when I decided
asynchronously to update this page. They aren't complete and I guarantee they will have changed by the time you read this.

Anyways, the idea exposited by this source code is that this application is event-centric: instead of investing 80 percent of the architcture in the domain model and 20 percent in the transactions that modify the domain, this application invests 80 percent of the architecture in the events that cause changes to the domain ("Domain Events") and only 20 percent in modelling the domain itself.

For more information on this subject, try doing a web search for &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=temporal+database">Temporal Database</a>&quot;. I'm grateful to Camiel Wolsing of CriSys Limited for suggesting this area of interest.

**Adding Continuations to the Java Programming Language**

These classes are part of another personal research project. My interest was in adding continuations to the Java Programming Language so that web applications could be written in Java using a Cocoon or Seaside style of programming. The benefit is that much of the session state management in a modern web application simply goes away, making software development simpler and more reliable. And as an added bonus, the new window, back button, and bookmarks all work all of the time, eliminating my major irritation with treating web browsers like a desktop GUI.

This &quot;Big Idea&quot; is that in a standard web application we cannot obtain information from the user in the middle of a method: we therefore cannot model a series of UI steps in a single method. Although some folks feel that isn't a good idea, the fact is that lots of web applications do have a series of sequential steps: try checking out of almost any e-commerce site.

The basis of the system is to rewrite Java methods so that they become 're-entrant': they become a loop enclosing a big switch statement, with all state stored in a big vector of parameters. The method can be restarted arbitrarily by passing in the current state and a label. The sample classes handle some of the Abstract Syntax Tree transformations required to flatten the tree into one level so that it can be rewritten as a switch statement.

The basis for the transformation is that the Java byte codes are parsed and mechanically transformed into an intermediate language. Certain special forms that would be keywords are represented as special static methods of a dummy class: those methods are turned into special forms in the intermediate language. In a tradition dating back to 1957, the intermediate language has an ascii representation featuring Lots of Interesting and Special Parentheses. That representation appears often in the test cases: it also makes it easy to decouple testing of the transformations from testing of the byte code parsing.

**Code Generation for Struts Development**

When working with large Struts development projects, managing changes to the struts-config file and your action classes is essential. I developed a collection of code generators in XSL that transformed a struts config file into a collection of action classes, interfaces, and business logic abstract base classes. This is useful if you have a tool automatically building the struts-config file from a source like a spreadsheet. Automatic generation saves a little coding time up front, but its real benefit is when the design goes through the inevitable refactoring: the classes are automatically updated and strong typing catches any places where business logic classes have not been updated. Thus, the combination of code generation and type checking makes refactoring easier.

		</TD>
		<TD>
			In conjunction with a build step that applies this XSL sheet to the struts-config.xml file,
    this generates a collection of Action java classes automatically. Each action class forwards to a Delegate class that actually contains
    the business logic. The idea is that a number of different actions might be handled by the same logic class. A
    special attribute added to each element in the structs-config file identifies the appropriate Delegate.
    
    The Action classes are responsible for forwarding action requests. A nice side effect for strong, declarative
    typing enthusiasts is that each forwarding call is strongly typed, documenting and enforcing the proper form bean's type in Java.

**Denumerables in Ruby**

I experimented with the Ruby programming language. While it doesn&#146;t have the power of Lisp&#146;s macros, it does have first class closures (you can even use the lambda keyword) and support for continuations. All this in a true object oriented language with support for operator overloading!

**Wireshooter in PHP**

<B>Wireshooter</B> was a database backed web site that published news and sports photos for download by magazines. Photographers uploaded their photos using a standard web browser, and then Wireshooter periodically rebuilt a static web site from its database. Here is the complete and uncommented source code, now available via Gnu Public License.

Basically, there were two servers: a public server running on an ISP&#146;s high speed line, and a private administration server running on our own system. The public server served up static files, and the private server ran Apache with mod_php. The files you see here all were on the private server.

The architecture was loosely MVC. The PHP pages accessible from the admin page were the controllers, the production site was the view, and the PHP include files were the model, handling control of the SQL database.

**</A>MetaCard Configuration Wizard**

**Scheme/Lisp Web Application Platform written in Java**

Here's some Java I wrote when building NAVajo and Firestorm (both of which are 100% Pure Java). NAVajo was a system which built static web pages from HTML pages with an embedded scripting language called 'MendelScheme'.

Firestorm was a web application server which used a Scheme/Lisp dialect as a scripting language to build dynamic web applications.

To make it perfectly clear: I wrote the interpreters for both MendelScript and Firestorm in Java, and both of these were used to build production web applications. Today we have J2EE, JSPs, ASPs, and various other web application platforms. But in 1996 these applications were cutting edge.

**Scheme Source Code**

The following examples are Scheme used to test the core Firescript interpreter. They were displayed on a virtual command line and do not reflect any web server functionality:

Firescript Source Code
---

The following examples are from the Firestorm application server. Firestorm was a web application server I wrote in 1997 which used a Scheme-based scripting language to build dynamic, user-centric web applications.

**XML and User Preferences**
  
This is part of a small module that demonstrates how to track user preferences. In this case, users of an online application can indicate whether they prefer English or French text, and whether they prefer graphics or text only (the demonstration was composed when 56K modems were uncommon):

<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=3>
	<COL WIDTH=33*>
	<COL WIDTH=223*>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=13%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/sartz.xml">sartz.xml</A>
			<BR><A HREF="source/firescript/about.dtd.txt">about.dtd</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=87%>
			An XML file containing language attributes. This module
			rendered the XML as HTML.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=13%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/display-preferences.lisp.txt">display-preferences.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=87%>
			This displays a preferences page for the user. Notable features
			are: recursively embedding Scheme and HTML inside each other; use
			of <B>this-session</B> dictionary and generalized variables; and
			the ability to 'call' this page from any other page.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=13%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/sartz.lisp">sartz.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=87%>
			The Firescript page which handles the display of <B>sartz.xml</B>.
			This follows the &quot;MVC&quot; pattern: the logic is embedded in
			this page, while the model is embedded in the XML page. And of
			course, the XML could be 'repurposed' in other forms.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=13%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/validate-preferences.lisp">validate-preferences.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=87%>
			A helper function encapsulated in a separate file. Shows that
			you can structure Firescript applications on a server.
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

**NAVajo update**

The NAVajo system was a predecessor to Firestorm. I reimplemented the application in Firescript to demonstrate the newer, more Scheme-like syntax. Of course, Firescript offered much more power than the original &quot;MendelScheme&quot; scripting language.

<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=3>
	<COL WIDTH=56*>
	<COL WIDTH=200*>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=22%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/navajo-scheme.lisp">navajo-scheme.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=78%>
			An implementation of NAVajo using Firescript. Compare to
			<A HREF="source/TEnglish.html.txt">TEnglish.html</A>.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=22%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/navajo-indexed.lisp">navajo-indexed.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=78%>
			An alternate implementation which uses indexed collections for
			performance reasons.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=22%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/navajo-dictionaries.lisp">navajo-dictionaries.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=78%>
			Yet another alternate implementation, this one using
			dictionaries for collection access.
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

**Displaying Dynamic Collections**

This is part of a small module that demonstrates how to display collections of things which can change. In this case, photos of Bryan Donald Bartle are dropped into a folder and Firestorm displays them in a crude photo book:

<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=3>
	<COL WIDTH=14*>
	<COL WIDTH=242*>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=5%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/List.lisp">List.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=95%>
			The file which completely describes the list of images. Note
			that (unlike the previous example) display code is intermingled
			with hard coded information about where to find the photos and
			what they are about. This demonstrates that Firestorm supported
			hacking out quick solutions <I>as well as</I> structured designs
			:-)
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=5%>
			<A HREF="source/firescript/detail.lisp">detail.lisp</A>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=95%>
			This displays a single photo in a simple page.
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

**SmallTalk Binary**

The only SmallTalk I can lay my hands on is an implementation of Streamized Programming for DigiTalk SmallTalk I wrote in 1983. Good luck filing it into your image!

<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=2>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD>
			<A HREF="source/VSTRM.CLS">VSTRM.CLS</A>
		</TD>
		<TD>
			A class which implements <B>streamized programming</B>, which
			uses delayed evaluation to allow extremely high level abstraction
			of infinite streams such as 'integers', 'primes', &amp;tc. Save it
			to your system and file it in.
